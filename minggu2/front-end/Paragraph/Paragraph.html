                    This paragraph is written with font family Courier New. The reason why i used this font family
                    is because i like the model of the font itself. And for the reason why the font is white, It's
                    because the background is black, or dark. So it doesnt hurt eyes a lot because the brightness.

                    This paragraph is written with font family Times New Romans. The reason why i used this font family
                    is because to mmake it different with before. And for the reason why the font is white, same as what
                    have told on the 1st paragraph. The reason is still same, just the font family is different.
